=============================
The aim of this example is to read data from and write data to USB devices using the CDC protocol. 
It makes the USB device look like a serial port (NO serial cable connectors:You can see the data
transferred to and from via USB instead of USB-to-USART bridge connection). 
This example loops back the contents of a text file over usb port. To run the example, Type a message using the Pc's keyboard.
Any data that shows in HyperTerminal is received from the device.
